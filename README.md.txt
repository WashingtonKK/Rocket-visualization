I modelled a rocket using Processing software and am cisualising it's orientation using an IMU, MPU6050

To run the service, you will need the Processing software: https://processing.org/download/
Also, you will need to have the Arduino software. 

I have provided the code to be used in both Processing software and on the arduino boards, both of which are modifications
from the library found in Arduino.

When you upload the code to arduino, do not open the serial monitor.
